I am Yuyang (Younger) Wu, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, computational chemistry, and natural language processing.

My work aims to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of large language models in scientific applications, particularly in chemistry and drug discovery. I am passionate about developing AI systems that can assist researchers in understanding complex molecular structures and chemical processes.

My recent research includes developing benchmarks for evaluating LLM performance in chemistry tasks, as well as novel graph neural network architectures for molecular property prediction. I believe in the potential of AI to accelerate scientific discovery while maintaining high standards of accuracy and interpretability.
